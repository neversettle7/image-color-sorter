# Image color sorter

### What does this program do?

Basically, it gets an image as input, then outputs the same image with his pixels sorted by color.

### Why did you decide to develop this (in)utility?

I wanted to learn Python development and I just kinda leaned towards this little idea that I had in mind for a long time.

### How do I get this stuff running?

Assuming you don't have Python already installed (especially if you're on windows), go grab it at [Python official site][Python_download].

Go ahead with the installation, then open a prompt window and type
    
    $ python

This will get you in a Python shell. Now type
    
    $ pip install Pillow

This will install [Pillow][Pillow_link] (Python Imaging Library), which is the library I'm currently using to work on images.

Looks like you're set!

Now go to the folder where you downloaded my software using your prompt window/terminal and type:

    $ python pixelsorter.py

Have fun!

### Your code sucks, bro.

Yes, I already know that. It's gonna be full of errors and poor-optimized code, but this is my first Python project, so take it easy.
