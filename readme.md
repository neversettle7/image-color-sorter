> What does this program do?

Basically, it gets an image as input, then outputs the same image with his pixels sorted by color.

> Why did you decide to develop this (in)utility?

I wanted to learn Python development and I just kinda leaned towards this little idea that I had in mind for a long time.

>Your code sucks, bro.

Yes, I already know that. It's gonna be full of errors and poor-optimized code, but this is just my first Python project.
